# FastCGI
Implementation of [FastCGI](http://seaside.gemtalksystems.com/ss/fastcgi/) for GemStone/Seaside based on a port of Steve Waring's Dolphin implementation (http://www.dolphinharbor.org/dh/projects/fs/).

The original FastCGI Project configuration : http://seaside.gemtalksystems.com/ss/MetacelloRepository.

Note: I have added a license to the project as the original files do not contain one.
